Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
I have written functions that are used to handle input strings from the user and tokenize every space-separated word. Words are separated into tokens by either ' ' or '\t' (tab). Any other character that the user might input is considered a valid character and is part of a word. Every line that the user inputs into the program that is not a command is recorded into a linked list called 'history'.


## Useful Commands

**> make** to compile the tokenizer program.

**> ./tokenizer** to run the newly created executable after compiling.

**> make clean** to clean temporary files from the project's directory. 


## Using the Tokenizer
1.You be promted to enter a string to tokenize it. (enter q to quit)
2. After you enter something, you can check your input history by entering
- **!#** replace the **#** with a number.
